```
Then, access [localhost](http://localhost).

## ðŸš€ Features
- Scrapes products from multiple coffee store websites (Python + BeautifulSoup)
- FastAPI backend with filtering, sorting, and leaderboard endpoints
- SQLite database + Celery and CRON automated caching

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python (FastAPI, BeautifulSoup)
- React+Vite(JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui)
- SQLite,Celery,CRON
- Docker

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
My first solo full-stack project, focused on:
- Web scraping
- API development
- React frontend basics
- UI design
- Data normalization
- Basic caching for performance

## ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements
- Add more coffee store scrapers  
<del>- Implement database caching with SQLite or Redis, replacing current caching</del>
- Add user accounts and favorites  
<del>- Schedule automatic refreshes with Celery or CRON, replacing "refresh" logic</del>
- AI chatbot for help
- Newsletter/Notification on product updates
- DB switch SQLite -> Docker and MySQL
